"""The outcome cohort one patient at a time, rather than one row per group.

Every other page in this app reports a group: an AUC, a cohort mean, a
threshold sweep. That is what a paper needs and it is not what a clinician
asks. This page answers "what happened to *this* patient, and how much should
I believe it" — which, on a cohort of twenty, is mostly a question about
caveats, so the caveats are the part that is hardest to miss here.

Named ``Patients`` rather than ``Cohort`` on purpose: ``data/cohort/`` already
holds the ds003029 feature table for the learned model, and a page called
Cohort that read ``data/outcome/`` would be a trap for the next reader.
