"""Which tissue was removed, and what happened to the patient afterwards.

Everything else in this package asks *where are the HFOs?*. This module
supplies the two facts needed to ask the question that actually matters --
**did removing the tissue that generated them stop the seizures?**

Two sidecars in ``ds003498`` carry them:

``sourcedata/clinical_ch_sheet_zurich.xlsx``
    One row per subject, with ``rz`` -- the **resected zone**, written as
    free-text contact ranges (``"ahr1-4, ar1-4, phr1-4"``) -- and
    ``excluded``, the contacts the original study dropped because electrical
    stimulation of them evoked a motor or language response (eloquent
    cortex). The dataset README quotes the paper on that exclusion.

``participants.tsv``
    ``outcome`` (``S`` seizure-free / ``F`` recurrence), the ILAE class,
    months of follow-up, and whether the epilepsy was temporal (TLE) or
    extratemporal (ETE).

Why this is fiddly, and why it is a module rather than three lines in a
notebook:

1. The sheet names **contacts** (``AHR1``), the analysis works on **bipolar
   channels** (``AHR1-AHR2``). A bipolar channel sits between two contacts,
   so it can be fully inside the resection, fully outside, or -- at the
   resection margin -- straddling it. Collapsing that third case into either
   of the others is a silent decision about the hardest channels in the
   dataset, so :func:`classify_channels` keeps it as its own label,
   ``partial``, and the analysis decides explicitly what to do with it.
2. Recorded channels are a subset of implanted contacts, and the sheet lists
   implanted ones. A resected contact that was never recorded cannot be
   scored, and its absence has to be *reported*, not absorbed: that is what
   ``coverage`` is for.
3. The sheet has a typo (subject 15's excluded list says ``1ll22-24`` where
   every other token on the row says ``tll``). Nothing here repairs it
   quietly; :class:`Resection` carries an ``unparsed`` field and
   :func:`resection_map` prints a warning.

Nothing in this module is specific to Zurich apart from the file path, which
lives in :class:`~onset_hfo.config.DatasetSpec`. A dataset without
``clinical_sheet`` simply has no resected zone, and the functions say so.
