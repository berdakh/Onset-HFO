"""Spectral description of a single event window.

One measurement matters more than any other in HFO work: *is there a peak in
the high-frequency band that stands above this recording's own 1/f
background?* A sharp transient (an epileptiform spike, an electrode pop)
contains energy at all frequencies, so a band-pass filter turns it into
something that looks like a ripple -- the classic false positive. A genuine
oscillation leaves a bump in the spectrum; ringing does not.

That is what :func:`event_spectral_peak` measures, and what
:mod:`onset_hfo.validate` thresholds.

    A single Hann-tapered, zero-padded periodogram -- *not* Welch averaging.
    Why it matters: an event is 30-100 ms long, so splitting it into
    overlapping Welch segments leaves 32-sample segments whose frequency grid
    is 31 Hz wide. On such a grid every ripple's "peak frequency" lands in the
    same bin (93.75 Hz on a 1000 Hz recording), which is a property of the bin
    edges, not of the brain.

    Zero-padding to at least 8x the window length interpolates the spectrum
    onto a fine grid. It does not create resolution that the window length
    cannot support -- a 40 ms window still cannot separate 150 from 160 Hz --
    but it does stop the estimate from being quantised to the band edge, and
    the peak it reports is the peak of the actual spectrum.
