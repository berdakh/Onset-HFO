"""Interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) detector.

"Epileptiform discharge" here means the classic interictal spike or sharp
wave: a brief (20-200 ms), high-amplitude, *sharp* deflection that stands out
from the background of its own channel.

The algorithm is deliberately the simplest thing that encodes what a reviewer
actually looks for:

1. band-pass 5-60 Hz (removes drift and most muscle/HF noise, keeps the
   spike's shape);
2. find peaks whose amplitude exceeds ``threshold_sd`` robust SDs of that
   channel;
3. require *sharpness*: the steepest slope inside the candidate must exceed
   ``slope_sd`` robust SDs of the channel's first derivative -- this is what
   separates a spike from a large slow wave;
4. take the event boundaries at half of the peak amplitude, and keep the event
   only if its duration falls in the accepted range;
5. reject candidates that sit on a *discontinuity* in the unfiltered signal:
   after a 5-60 Hz band-pass an electrode pop looks like a perfectly good
   sharp wave, so this check is made on the raw samples, where a pop jumps in
   one sample and a discharge does not;
6. enforce a refractory period so one discharge is counted once.

It is not a trained classifier and it does not try to be: it is a transparent
baseline that a clinician can argue with, and the number it produces
(discharges per minute per channel) is the quantity every HFO study reports
alongside HFO rate.
